# Project Overview

This project is a simple stopwatch application built using React. The application allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer. The elapsed time is displayed in a format of minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. The stopwatch is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

`App.jsx`

The App.jsx file serves as the entry point for the application. It imports the Stopwatch component and renders it within the application.

`Stopwatch.jsx`

The Stopwatch.jsx file contains the main logic for the stopwatch. It uses React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useRef to manage the state and handle the timer functionalities.

The index.css file provides basic styling for the application. It includes styles for the stopwatch display and control buttons.


`Start Button: Click to start or resume the timer.`
